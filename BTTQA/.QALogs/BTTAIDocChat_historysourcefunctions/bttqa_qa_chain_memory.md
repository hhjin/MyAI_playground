    How the components in btt.xml work
    When you call InitManager.reset() method, the InitManager performs the following actions: 
    ▪   parses the btt.xml file
    ▪   finds out all the component tags
    ▪   gets the value of <field id="initializer"/> tag for each component
    ▪   instantiates the Initializer for each component 
    ▪   calls Initializer.initialize() method.
    Then the Initializer of the component will get initialized. The InitManager gets all the UDTT components initialized one by one, such as data, format, context, invoker, operation, processor and so forth. Furthermore, if you remove the configuration for a component, the component will not be initialized. In this way, you can choose which components to use, and disable the other components.
