Human: how to make web service call?
Assistant: {
  "answer": "To make a web service call, you can follow these steps:\n1. Use the UNICOM® Digital Transformation Toolkit (UDTT™) as the client-side.\n2. Directly use the BTTWSServiceHandlerProxy without the need to generate a client.\n3. Create an instance of the BTTWSServiceHandlerProxy class with the web service URL.\n4. Prepare the necessary parameters for the web service call.\n5. Call the desired operation using the web service.\n6. Handle the response returned by the web service.\n\nAlternatively, if you are not using UDTT as the client-side, you can:\n1. Use the UDTT provided WSDL to generate a proxy.\n2. Call the proxy using the generated code.\n\nPlease note that the specific implementation may vary depending on the web service framework or technology being used.",
