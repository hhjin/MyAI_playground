    Client engine
    The client engine enables developers to use any framework they like on the client server, so that the server can focus on business flows and data processes. For more information, see ‘Client engine’ on page 699.
    To help you to learn how to use the client engine API and speed up your development process, a sample application is provided. For more information, see Using the client engine with a UDTT server application.
    Client engine service for Angular and Ionic
    The client engine service for Angular and Ionic is based on the client engine API.
    To help you to learn how to use the client engine API and speed up your development process, a sample application is provided. For more information, see Using the client engine service in an Angular project.

    Licensing
    This version checks your product license by using the UNICOM License Server. See Licensing UNICOM Digital Transformation Toolkit. You must also configure your projects and UDTT Tools to work with it: see License Server: UDTT project configuration and License Server: UDTT Tools configuration.
    Label widget: Dynamic links
    A new function enables you to add dynamic links to labels. See Link in Text.
    SelectList and ComboBox widgets: Performance enhancements
    The selectList and comboBox widgets can now store the data for their lists by using a cache service, instead of calling the data every time they are used. See Cache service for SelectList and ComboBox.
    Support for different versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer
    To support different versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer, a new tag for templates is available. See Support for Microsoft Internet Explorer: DojoDocMode tag.
    Dynamically inserted abstracted components
    To support dynamically inserted abstracted components, use the new dynamic flow states. See Dynamic flows.
    XMLGregorianCalendar support
    To support XMLGregorianCalendar, the ECA includes 14 new functions. See BTTUtilitiesFunctions category.
    Improved float precision
    The float precision of JavaScript expression evaluation is improved in both client side and server side. For example, in previous versions, 0.3 + 0.1 was calculated as 0.400000004 in raw JavaScript; in the new version, it is calculated as 0.4. See Number Functions category.
    Improved AJAX flow
    The AJAX Flow is improved to support the refresh or update of a subcontainer of a client page after a popup page state, or even no refreshing or updating or re-rendering after a new added transition named “do nothing” at UDTT flow processor. See Drawing flows in the flow editor.
    Data cache service for remote flowing mapping data
    A data cache service is provided for remote flow mapping data temporary caches

    How the components in btt.xml work
    When you call InitManager.reset() method, the InitManager performs the following actions: 
    ▪   parses the btt.xml file
    ▪   finds out all the component tags
    ▪   gets the value of <field id="initializer"/> tag for each component
    ▪   instantiates the Initializer for each component 
    ▪   calls Initializer.initialize() method.
    Then the Initializer of the component will get initialized. The InitManager gets all the UDTT components initialized one by one, such as data, format, context, invoker, operation, processor and so forth. Furthermore, if you remove the configuration for a component, the component will not be initialized. In this way, you can choose which components to use, and disable the other components.
